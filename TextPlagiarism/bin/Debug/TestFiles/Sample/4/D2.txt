[1] INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM  The Year 2000 (Y2K) technology problem started as an innocuous short-term solution to the oppressively high cost of computer memory in the 1950s and 1960s. 
[3] Fifty years after the introduction of the computer, the Y2K problem has the potential to develop into a worldwide crisis. [4] Two common human failings contributed to the crisis -- tendency to follow a path of least resistance and the reluctance to champion difficult and complex issues. 
[5] The Y2K problem does not have to be a story of failure, however. 
[6] If addressed successfully, Y2K may encourage political and corporate leaders to better understand and protect the critical infrastructure. 
[8] Newer versions of hardware and software needed to interface with older versions. 
[9] While some programs were modified so that a new system could accept four-digit years and still exchange information with two-digit based systems, the extra effort required slowed the changeover process.
